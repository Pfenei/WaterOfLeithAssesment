                    The Dean Village is a tranquil green oasis on the Water of Leith, only five minutes’ walk from
                    Princes Street.
                    Dean Village was previously where milling of water mills took place, of which remains of this can
                    still be seen by visitors. Hidden in the village, you will come across a variety of mill stones and
                    stone plaques decorated with baked bread and pies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Dean Bridge can also be found if you walk
                    along the walkway following the Water of Leith. The Bridge and St Bernard's Well were both designed
                    by Thomas Telford.
                    At the heart of the village is Well Court, the most iconic building in the village. This building
                    was built in the 1880s and housed local workers who worked at the water mills.</p>

                    The Dean Bridge spans the Water of Leith in the city of Edinburgh on the A90 road to Queensferry on
                    the Firth of Forth. It carries the roadway, 447 feet (136 m) long and 39 feet (12 m) broad, on four
                    arches rising 106 feet (32 m) above the river. The bridge was one of the last major works before
                    retirement of the bridge designer, civil engineer Thomas Telford, and was completed in 1831 when he
                    was seventy-three years old.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before the bridge was built the river had been crossed since medieval times at a ford, later by a
                    single-arch stone bridge near the same spot, at the foot of Bell's Brae in the Dean Village. The
                    private Dean Gardens lie under the east side of the bridge on the north bank of the Water of Leith.
                    This bridge is an important location in the novel <a class="aboutlink"

                <p>
                    Between Dean Village and Stockbidge above the Water of Leith proudly stands a statue of the Greek
                    Goddess of Health, Hygeia. Protected by eight towering pillars, the deity stands atop of one of
                    Edinburgh's best kept secrets - a spring said to be capable of curing all manner of ailments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1760 a natural spring was allegedly discovered by three members of George Heriot's above the
                    Water of Leith and quickly became an attraction for Edinburgh residents.
                    At the time drinking from springs or "taking the waters" was said to be an effective remedy for
                    healing various maladies. Twenty-nine years following its discovery, St Bernard's Well was erected.
                    The well takes its name from Saint Bernard of Clairvaux who according to local
                    legend had spent time living in a nearby cave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The structure itself was designed by Edinburgh painter Alex Nasmyth, who is best known for his
                    drawings of the city's landscape and his portrait of poet Robert Burns.
                    Beneath the statue is the pump room which hold's the spring. Ostentatiously designed with mosaics
                    and white, blue and gold paints, the room has been largely closed to the public since 1940.
